AI Generated Text Adventure Game and Story Generator

# Description
Generate a story using ChatGPT and Leonardo AI to build a story with associated images and (eventually) export the product as an ebook or printable book format.

# Packages
We used the required ```express.js``` and ```node.js``` to set up our routes and run the app through the CLI.\
We used ```mysql``` to communicate with our database.\
We used ```sequelize``` to handle our data and database.\
We used ```handlebars``` with express as our template engine.\
We use ```dotenv``` to store environment variables.\
We imported and intend to use ```fs``` file saver so users can download and store their files locally.\
We imported and intend to use ```uuid``` and \
We imported ```bcrypt``` and ```express-sessions``` to authorize, authenticate, and encrypt users and their data.\
```uuid``` was also imported and will be used to generate unique ID's for users when we get validation running.

# Technologies
The main two technologies we used were ```openAI ChatGPT v3.5``` and ```Leonardo AI``` as an image generator for our prompts/scenarios/images.\

We tried to also use ```animejs``` but ran out of time. This tech would be used as a placeholder or splash screen while the other data is being generated.
